## Summary

This was created in response to 'Twig Education Coding Challenge'. It contains a callable function (`divideArray()`) which takes two params - an array and a positive integer (n) - and returns a new array, which is the original array passed as a parameter divided into n pieces. It includes tests to ensure the code works as expected and to document expected behaviour. It contains function comment headers to document expected behaviour.
